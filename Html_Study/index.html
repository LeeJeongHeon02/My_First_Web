		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger" target="_blank" title="Hamburger - Wikipedia">A hamburger</a>, or simply burger, is a <strong><u>sandwich</u> consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat</strong>, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.
	</p>

	<p style="margin-top:20px;">
		Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.<p>
	</p>

	Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and other restaurants.
	<br>There are many international and regional variations of hamburger.
